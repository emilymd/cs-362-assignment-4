# cs-362-assignment-4
This is a GitHub repository for our Software Engineering II Assignment 4. 
For this assignment, we have to write automated tests for this Java-based HTML web-app.
This web-app is a Battleship game. At the time of the release uploaded to this repository,
there are two special tools included outside of normal Battleship play:
* Implement a Captain's Quarter on each ship. Placement is as follows
  * 1st square of Minesweeper
  * 2nd square of Destroyer
  * 3rd square of Battleship
* On Minesweeper, 1 hit on CQ sinks the whole ship
* On the other two ships, 2 hits on the CQ will sink the whole ship
* After sinking one ship, a player is able to use "Sonar Pulse" that will show a 3X3  
  square that shows empty and occupied squares. Player can only do this twice.
